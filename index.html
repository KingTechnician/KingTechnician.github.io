                    <p>I am a current student at Virginia State University majoring in computer science with the intent to receive a bachelor's degree. I am a Stanford University Innovation Fellow, National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering Scholar, and a junior full-stack developer.</p>
                    <p>My primary skills include backend programming in Java and Python and frontend experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have experience with web application frameworks like Flask, and server management through Amazon Web Services and MongoDB.</p>
                    <p>As a Stanford University Innovation Fellow, I am gladly tasked to provide change within my college campus (Virginia State University) by introducing and/or increasing the innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) landscape for students and faculty alike.</p>
                    <p>I have participated in a program at the University of Kentucky, sponsored by Google, where I learned machine learning and deep learning concepts and applied this eduction to a hands-on project with a team. I led a team in creating the Freeman-Wilson-Delgado-Ellis (FWDE) Model, a model meant to analyze MRI images and isolate locations of certain thigh muscles.</p>

                    <p>Virginia State University has numerous resources to ensure a full and valuable student experience, but there remains to be a centralized platform for viewing a well-managed tally of feedback from students.</p>
                    <p>A solution presented by me, Isaiah Freeman, is Priam, a web application that has the goal of making the desires of students more visible to faculty and administration to Virginia State University.</p>

                    <p>The Priam web application is simple; you might consider it a voting system. Students have the ability to create an account, and propose changes they would like to make to the university in a short post.</p>

                <div class="aboutContent container">
                    <p>At the University of Kentucky Health Center, muscle injuries are commomplace, occurring for people who experience an accident or an athlete who gets injured in the intensity of their sport. While MRI imaging can provide a deep understanding of the nature of the injury, it can be more difficult to differentiate thigh muscles. These partitions are often made by hand, which is time consuming and subject to human error. The solution would be to have an automated way of recognizing the shapes of thigh muscles and highlight them in a way that can be useful for diagnoses and treatments.</p>
                    <p>Our project's goal was to provide a basis through which the UK Health Department can automatically identify muscles of the thigh. In our two-week long work, we were tasked with creating a model to isolate the vastus lateralis, a muscle located on the lateral side of the thigh.</p>
                    <p>The Freeman-Wilson-Delgado-Ellis (FWDE) model was trained with images from real subjects of varying thigh sizes and time frames. Our model enacts a process of classifying images pixel-by-pixel, referred to commonly as image segmentation. Using the U-Net architecture, our model downscales the images after each layer, then upscales them into a matrix of classification values, or binary masks. These binary masks, when overlayed on the original image, will highlight the area of interest where the vastus lateralis is located.</p>
                    <p>Provided that we can identify the vastus lateralis reliably enough, the next steps would be for the UK Health Center to train the FWDE Model to identify more muscles of the thigh.</p>
                    <p>Libraries used include Tensorflow (through Keras and Tensorflow Datasets), Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.</p>
                    <p>The GitHub repository for this project, at this time, is private, as confidential patient data is privatized appropriately.</p>

                    <p>The welcome of change starts with diverse conversations.</p>
                    <p>The process of making change begins with the collective.</p>
                    <p>As Stanford University Innovation Fellows, myself and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laquawne-depriest-86412012a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >LaQuawne DePriest</a> were given the opportunity to share what we want fellow scholars of innovation to know. We chose the above two sentences as the basis of our article, "Visions of Change."</p>
                    <p>On page 93, we conclude the 2nd volume of the excellent publication Change Forward, a journal from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hasso-plattner-institute-of-design-at-stanford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford ( d.school )</a>, meant to document the work ethic, continued learning, and development of Fellows.</p>
                    <p>The years 2021 and 2022 have been very surreal for me. Exactly a year ago, I was a freshman at Virginia State University, just beginning my first steps as a software engineer, college student, and adult. A few months before that, I was a high school student deciding the ideal places to apply for college. I still feel like that high school senior in some ways. In other ways, I can feel meaningful growth and maturation. I see the same growth in LaQuawne, and in many other classmates I study with daily.</p>
                    <p>Many thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-shelton-89022a27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >Dr. Joseph Shelton</a> for continually serving as my Faculty Champion and encouraging me forward.

                    <p>In my article section, I detai la new focus for change. The culmination of my work is soon to come. I encourage you to read our article and explore the journal in general to garner new perspectives from all over the globe.</p>
                    <p>Collective growth never stops. neither will I.</p>
